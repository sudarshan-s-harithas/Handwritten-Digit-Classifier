# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-
A Convolution Neural Network is built to classify MNIST  Handwritten Digit Recognition.Here digit recognition is implemented using tensorflow and pytorch 


In this tutorial, we'll build a TensorFlow and Pytorch model to recognize handwritten digits with a convolutional neural network. First, we'll train the classifier by having it "look" at thousands of handwritten digit images from the MNIST handwritten digit dataset and their labels. Then we'll evaluate the classifier's accuracy using test data that the model has never seen.

This task is considered a classification task as we are training the model to assign a category (the digit that appears in the image) to the input image. We will train the model by showing it many examples of inputs along with the correct output. This is referred to as supervised learning.
